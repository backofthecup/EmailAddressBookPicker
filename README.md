EmailAddressBookPicker
======================
This is a custom iOS email address book picker. It uses a `UITableViewController` to list all contacts in the address book that contain at least one email address. If more than one email address exists for a contact an `UIActionSheet` will prompt user to select one. It also uses a `UISearchDisplayController` to allow the user to filter the list.
